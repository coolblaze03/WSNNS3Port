This is my NS3 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Research.

Enclosed in the Scratch Folder you will find all source for the network. 

It consist of a variation of a multi sink network. It uses a very simple rounding protocol to save time and nodal resources.
This simple Routing implementation will also in the future allow piggy backing of data over the protocol with 
increased message overhead but minimize the number of messages being sent as a whole. 

Its still a very much work in progress and any feedback is much appreciated.
